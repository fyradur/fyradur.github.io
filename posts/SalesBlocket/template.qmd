If you search a certain item you can see all other sellers and their prices and when they published the
advert. But what you can't see is previous sold products. What if you want to have an idea of
if you publish a certain product with a certain price how long will it take until you sell it?
In this post we'll try to estimate this value using available data.

will be the expected value.

# Variables
